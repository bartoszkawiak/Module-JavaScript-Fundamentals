const movieLength = -8784.08; // length of movie in seconds

const remainingSeconds = movieLength % 60;
const totalMinutes = (movieLength - remainingSeconds) / 60;

const remainingMinutes = totalMinutes % 60;
const totalHours = (totalMinutes - remainingMinutes) / 60;

const result = `${totalHours}:${remainingMinutes}:${remainingSeconds}`;
console.log(result);

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions

// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?

// b) How many function calls are there?

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer

//a) There are 6 variable declarations.
//b)There is 1 function call on line 10
//c) movieLength use remainder operator % . movieLength % 60 returns the remaining seconds after dividing the movie length into full minutes.
//d) expression assigned to totalMinutes calculate movie time in whole minutes.
//e) This variable represent total movie time in hh/mm/ss format, we could name it totalTime or totalMovieTime.
//f) Yes, the code works correctly when movieLength is non-negative whole number that represents seconds.
